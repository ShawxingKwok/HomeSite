This website displays most of my personal open-source works in which {{< newTab `MVB` "/ITWorks/docs/multiplatform/mvb/android/" >}}
is the representative. Note that I center on **Kotlin**, and only `Android.KDataStore` considers `Java` supports.

My code is probably the globally best at present for its functionality, creativity, concision, difficulty, structure,
efficiency, and beauty. Wish you could learn from itÔºÅI also encourage those authorities to provide better
tutorials with embedded short videos instead of all voluminous words and pictures.

In addition, if you are familiar with IT but feel hard to learn Kotlin and love Java or Go more, your logic
ability may not be well enough for you to engage in IT. If so, do something you love and excel
at. I have no offensive intention, just meaning everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and every
job has its threshold.

At last, my works are not perfect. Some need plugins with visual interfaces, some are in the proposal stage, and there are
some other wonderful ideas but not displayed. I need some top company to help complete and popularize. Welcome to visit my

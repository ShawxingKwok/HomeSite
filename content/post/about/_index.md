This website displays most of my personal open-source works. Note that I center on **Kotlin**,
and only `Android.KDataStore` considers `Java` supports.

My code is probably the globally best at present for its functionality, creativity, difficulty, structure,
efficiency, and beauty. Wish you could learn from itÔºÅI also encourage those authorities to provide better
tutorials with embedded short videos instead of all voluminous words.

In addition, if you are familiar with IT but feel hard to learn Kotlin and love Java or Go more, your logic
ability mustn't be well enough for you to engage in IT. If so, do something you love and must excel
at. I have no offensive intention, just meaning everyone has his strengths and weaknesses, and every
job has its threshold.

At last, **I have two other halfway wonderful works** and am waiting for some top company to help make IDE plugins.
I have sent resumes to common top IT companies, but those limited resume sizes are too small and they
didn't give me opportunities to display.

This website displays all my personal open-source works which are all written in `Kotlin-jvm` at present. 

[//]: # (Partial works display Tracer & KDataStore)

My code is probably the globally best at present for its functionality, creativity, difficulty, structure, 
efficiency, and beauty. Wish you could learn from itÔºÅI also encourage those authorities to provide better 
tutorials with embedded short videos instead of all voluminous words.

In addition, if you are familiar with IT, feel hard to learn Kotlin and love Java or Go more, your logic
ability mustn't be well enough for you to engage in IT. If so, do something you love and must excel
at. I have no offensive intention, just meaning everyone has his strengths and weaknesses, and every
job has its threshold.

At last, **I have two other halfway done wonderful works** and am waiting for some company to help make IDE plugins.
I have sent resumes to common top internet companies, but those limited resume sizes are too small
and they didn't give me opportunities to display.

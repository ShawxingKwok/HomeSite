# Elements structure graph
This could be automatically generated background. 

# Let hints **'unused'** unrelate to `Tracer`  
For this example below, `X` and `i` are both later referenced by `Tracer` and are not grey anymore.

# Highlighted name
It's better for you to inject like `private val bedroom get() =`
_**Bedroom**`_House_masterBedroom` in which `Bedroom` is expectedly displayed in another
highlighted color.

When you input code in a big project, too many tracer property name hints appear at present.
(Only one in this example because this sample project is small)

Generated tracer property names wouldn't appear until your input starts with `_`.

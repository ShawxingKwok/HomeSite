This proposal requires official assistance to design visual operation interfaces.
The goal is to make view source code from the UI department directly usable by IT developers, including visually
designed animations. If this could be implemented, it could reduce most code
as well as negotiations between UI and IT developers, which is revolutionary without doubt.

All the expected effects are explained in abstract words. Hope you to be patient.
